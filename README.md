**Q. Let’s say that you work at a food delivery company. You’re tasked with discovering how late the late orders actually are.**
**1. Which is a better metric to look at? The average or the median?**
A. The distribution will be right skewed and mean is more sensitive to extreme observation or outliers.

**2. What does that tell us about the late orders?**
A. There would be very few orders that are super late most of them would be few minutes late with outliers which is uncommon.

**Q. Say you are given a dataset of perfectly linearly separable data. What would happen when you run logistic regression?**
A. The situation can introduce numeric instability in your algorithm (mess with standard errors, p-values, etc.). For linear separable data sets the model parameters go to infinity when mimizing the error function

**Q. What is the difference between covariance and correlation?**
A. Covariance: Covariance and correlation are two terms that are opposed and are both used in statistics and regression analysis. Covariance shows you how the two variables differ, whereas correlation shows you how the two variables are linearly related.
The size of the covariance is difficult to interpret because it has units. If the two variables have different units, then how can we interpret the covariance
Scaling affects the value of covariance. For example, covariance would be 11000 if the sales were measured in hundreds.
Correlation is between -1 to 1, whereas covariance can  be anything.

**What is Bootstrapping?**
